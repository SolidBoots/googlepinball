<h2 align="center">An attempt to recreate the Google Pinball game on the iOS Google App</h2>
<p align="center"><strong>A or D, or Arrows to Move the Paddles. As for mobile, just tap on the screen.</strong></p>
<p align="center">If there are any glitches or bugs, let me know before it's too late.</p>
<p align="center">I don't really feel like adding any "extra" features, as I kinda just did the bare minimum but I think it turned out alright. If you really want more then I might consider adding stuff, but right now I don't plan to.</p>
<p align="center">But things like extra settings or buttons or any small fix/thing I probably will do.</p>
<p align="center">Note that the physics may be a bit janky as I can't really fix that issue, but if like the ball goes through stuff or it gets stuck then thats not normal.</p>
<p align="center">Check out <a href="https://solidboots.itch.io/google-pinball">the itch.io page if you want to leave a comment</a> (because idk how to use Github currently)</p>
<p align="center">Maybe you can leave an issue, but preferably go to the itch page, im only using github for the sites for this repo</p>
